    <p>The <a href="https://datascience.ch/">Swiss Data Science Center</a> has been created to realise the national <a href="https://www.ethrat.ch/sites/default/files/FactSheet_Data_Science_E.pdf">Initiative for Data Science in Switzerland</a> to accelerate data science, through both an expansion of education and research, and the provision of infrastructure for data science users across disciplines.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renga">RENGA</a> platform allows scientists to securely share and trace access to data sets, source code and experiment results. Downsteam users can reproduce results or fork them to build on previous work. In 2018 crowdAI will be integrated into the RENGA platform, allowing challenge submission history to be viewed within the RENGA graph, and for participants to build on the work of others and link to their results, using an API or interactive environments such as Jupyter Notebooks.</p>

    <p><strong>This is a call for a unique, large-scale challenge to be run on the crowdAI platform for data science questions with a public interest or research focus.</strong></p>

    <p>Challenges may run across domains and disciplines, with datasets shared publicly via the crowdAI platform. The proposed challenge duration is two to three months, but organisers may request a different duration or a multi-stage event.</p>

    <p>The challenge will have early access to RENGA as a storage and execution environment. Computing resources can be requested for the challenge in a manner defined by the challenge organiser. For example an execution environment for a Reinforcement Learning challenge.</p>

    <p>The tentative schedule is as follows:
    - Submission deadline for challenges: <strong>July 22, 2018 (22:00 UTC)</strong>
    - Acceptance notification deadline for challenges: July 30, 2018
    - Start of challenges: September 2018 (to be defined by challenge organizers)
    - End of challenges: November/December 2018 (to be defined by challenge organizers)</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.crowdai.org/">crowdAI</a> is a platform for open data science challenges. crowdAI helps universities, government agencies, NGOs and businesses to run and manage their data challenges. The crowdAI platform is an open source infrastructure that can immediately reach thousands of data scientists around the world to work on interesting data problems.</p>

    <p>While still running challenges for the global research community, we believe that industry could benefit from the large number of crowdAI data scientists and from the platform itself. A company that rapidly needs to find a solution to a data science problem either depends on an in-house team of data scientists, or needs to buy the expertise from a third party. In both cases, the reach of data science expertise is limited and cost intensive. Crowd-sourced data science challenges offer a solution to this problem by making the data science challenge immediately available to thousands of data science experts.</p>

    <p>The experts are often students or have data science jobs already, but are looking to hone their skills on interesting real-world problems.</p>

    <p><strong>We are looking for data science challenges that industry faces.</strong></p>

    <p>crowdAI recently received a grant from <a href="https://enable.epfl.ch/">enable</a>, an EPFL Technology Transfer Office program aimed at facilitating the path towards commercialization of EPFL innovative technologies and stimulation innovation. This grant of CHF 10’000 is to be used as challenge prizes, to be matched by the industry partner.</p>
