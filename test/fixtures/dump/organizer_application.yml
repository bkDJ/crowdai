  organization_description: We are organizing a workshop on Causality and Machine
    Learning at the NIPS'17 conference (https://nips.cc/Conferences/2017/Schedule?showEvent=9563).
    The organization team includes researchers from Microsoft Research and professors
    at Cornell, Duke, University of Chicago and University College London. We want
    to host a companion challenge with the workshop that serves as a test-bed for
    counterfactual learning.
  challenge_description: "We are proposing a challenge problem based on the first
    real-world dataset of logged contextual bandit feedback with non-uniform action-selection
    propensities (https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00367). The dataset consists of several
    gigabytes of data from an ad placement system, which we have processed into multiple
    well-defined learning problems of increasing complexity, feedback signal, and
    context. The dataset is already hosted on AWS (https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/reco-dataset/CriteoBannerFillingChallenge.tar.gz).\r\n\r\nA
    subset of the data that is most relevant for the proposed challenge is about ~3GB
    train/1,5GB test and has already been pre-processed with appropriate features.
    The evaluation metric is non-standard, and most similar to a weighted version
    of 0/1 accuracy (see http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~adith/Criteo/).\r\n\r\nWe are
    on a tight schedule and the challenge is time-critical (since NIPS workshop submissions
    are already open and the conference takes place in December). Awaiting your prompt
    response! Thanks!"

  challenge_description: "We are planning to host a challenge on multimodal emotion
    recognition problem with missing data. At the moment we have a draft of problem
    description and are preparing the data (train set, public and private tests).\r\n\r\nHere
    are the questions that matter to us the most:\r\n1. What's the cost of hosting
    a challenge on your platform? What does it consist of (platform fee, prize pool.
    etc.)? What's the average prize offered in your challenges?\r\n2. How do you promote
    new challenges?\r\n3. What's the size and demographics of your data science community?
    What's the average number of teams/participants per challenge?\r\n4. What's the
    form for submissions requested from participants: just output files or working
    code?\r\n5. Can we offer an additional prize(s) based on a subjective metric,
    e.g. \"most innovative\"?\r\n6. How can we as a client own the winning solutions?
    Can we get a full ownership (exclusive license)?\r\n7. Can anyone see the winning
    solutions (actual code)?\r\n8. Are winners requested to make final fixes and provide
    a documentation explaining the logic behind their winning algorithm?\r\n9. Can
    anyone see the problem description and download data after the challenge ends?"
